MAZES Security Group - Sleep Tight With Security

In this project, a Raspberry Pi Pico will be used to design and construct a smart home security system that incorporates LED lighting, an LCD display module, passive and active buzzers, and an infrared motion sensor. Motion detection is the system's primary feature for improving home security. Alerts are triggered when the infrared motion sensor detects the presence of people or objects. The active and passive buzzers sound warnings when they detect something, and the LED lights change color, turning red to indicate an alert and green to indicate a safe environment. 

Real-time updates are provided via the LCD module, which shows messages such as "All Clear" or "Motion Detected." To guarantee accuracy and dependability, this system will be calibrated and configured on a daily or weekly basis, depending on the parameters we set in place. 

In everyday circumstances, this system can be used as a compact, cost-effective security solution for homes, workplaces, or small enterprises, providing an efficient means of monitoring and responding to suspicious activity or unauthorized entry. By integrating visual and audio indicators, this system not only enhances safety but also offers peace of mind to users, ensuring they are promptly alerted to potential threats. Furthermore, its scalability and affordability make it an attractive option for individuals seeking to customize their security needs while maintaining simplicity and reliability in operation.
